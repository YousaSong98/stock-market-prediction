# stock-market-prediction

We participated in a group of 5, predicting stock markets of particular assets under Google Colab and delivering presentations.
In the group, I was mainly in charge of fetching and preprocessing real-time historical data of tech giantsâ€™ stock prices with Yahoo Finance API and Python data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. I collaborated with colleagues on implemented feature engineering to build a CNN-LSTM model, optimizing and achieving a decent score of loss on predicting the stock prices.
